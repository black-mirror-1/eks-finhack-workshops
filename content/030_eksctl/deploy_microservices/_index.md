# Deploy an example Microservice

The microservice we will use as an example, is a trivial web service that uses a [Monte Carlo method to approximate pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_integration) written in go. You can find the application code in in [this github repo](https://github.com/ruecarlo/eks-workshop-sample-api-service-go)
