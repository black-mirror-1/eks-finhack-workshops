**Congratulations!** you have reached the end of this module. We covered a lot of ground on how to apply diversification to Kubernetes and EKS workloads using EC2 Spot.

  * Log into the **[EC2 Spot Request](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2sp/v1/spot/home)** page in the Console.
  * Click on the **Savings Summary** button.

We have achieved a significant cost saving over On-Demand prices that we can apply in a controlled way and at scale. We hope this savings will help you try new experiments or build other cool projects. **Now Go Build** !
